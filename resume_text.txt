PROJECTS AT EMERTXE 
 
Project number:1 
 
Title Inverted Search 
Project brief Inverted Search is a C -based project that creates an inverted index from multiple text 
files. It maps each word to the Hash table and files , along with the count of the word 
and file, enabling fast and efficient word searching across files. 
Technologies used Advanced C - File Handling, Hash Tables, Linked Lists, and Dynamic Memory 
Allocation, Command line arguments 
Key challenges & Learnings  ✓ Handling file parsing and word extraction efficiently while managing case 
sensitivity and duplicates. 
✓ Implementing hash tables and linked lists for optimized data storage and quick 
search operations. 
✓ Faced segmentation faults while handling main and sub -node addresses and 
resolved them by understanding the correct usage of NULL, thereby enhancing 
knowledge of data structures, modular design, problem -solving, and memory 
management in C. 
 
Project number:2  
Title Arbitrary Precision Calculator 
Project brief Arbitrary Precision Calculator is a C -based project that performs mathematical 
operations on very large numbers beyond the standard data type limits. It uses arrays or 
linked lists to represent numbers and supports operations like addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division with high accuracy. 
Technologies used Advanced C – Pointers, Linked Lists, Structure, Dynamic Memory Allocation, 
Command line arguments 
Key challenges & Learnings  ✓ Developed custom logic to perform arithmetic operations on large numbers without 
relying on built-in data types. 
✓ Learned to manage memory efficiently and represent data effectively using linked 
lists. 
✓ Gained a strong understanding of number handling, algorithm optimization, and 
precision control in C programming. 
 
Project Number:3  
Title Image Steganography using LSB 
Project brief The objective of the project was to securely embed a secret text file within a BMP 
image. The process involved encoding the length of the secret text followed by 
embedding the text data into the least significant bits (LSB) of the image bytes. During 
decoding, the length was first extracted, and the hidden text was then retrieved bit by 
bit, ultimately reconstructing the original secret message. 
Technologies used Advanced C – File operations, Pointers, Bitwise operations, Functions, Makefiles, 
Command line arguments  
Key challenges & Learnings  ✓ Gained understanding of image pixels and BMP file headers through detailed 
literature study. 
✓ Implemented data embedding and extraction techniques ensuring that the original 
image properties remained unchanged. 
✓ Faced issues in bitwise operations during LSB implementation by mistakenly 
altering the MSB instead of the LSB, which helped in gaining a better 
understanding of bit manipulation and binary data handling in image processing.  
Project number:4  
Title Address Book 
Project brief The Address Book project is a C -based application that stores and manages contact 
information such as name, phone number, and email. It allows users to add, search, edit, 
delete, and display contacts with proper input validation and modularized design for 
efficient data handling. 
Technologies used Advanced C – Pointers, Structures, File Handling, Command line arguments 
Key challenges & Learnings  ✓ Faced challenges in implementing input validation to maintain data integrity for 
names, phone numbers, and emails, improving understanding of error handling.  
✓ Encountered difficulties in managing file handling and ensuring proper data 
storage and retrieval, which strengthened skills in data persistence. 
✓ Learned the importance of modular programming and code reusability for building 
a well-structured and easily maintainable project. 
 
 
ACADEMIC PROJECTS 
 
Title IoT-based Fire Alarming System using GSM Module 
Project brief The IoT-based Fire Alarm System that integrates GSM communication with sensor -
based fire detection. The system enhances conventional fire alarms by sending SMS 
and call alerts to predefined contacts when a fire is detected, ensuring immediate 
notification even when users are away from the site. 
Technologies used Embedded Systems, IoT, GSM, Sensor Technology, Arduino IDE 
Key challenges & Learnings  ✓ Calibrating the MQ -2 and LM35 sensors with Arduino was tricky at first, but it 
helped us understand sensor behaviour and fine-tune readings. 
✓ Faced GSM module issues due to power and command errors, which we fixed by 
studying the datasheet and ensuring a stable power supply. 
✓ The system worked differently in real-time compared to simulation, teaching us to 
adjust thresholds and improve our code for reliable results.
